# Maddy's Calculator
My first project 'Calculator' using java.

A simple Java-based calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI) using AWT. This calculator supports basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program uses action listeners to handle button events and provides real-time calculation results.
